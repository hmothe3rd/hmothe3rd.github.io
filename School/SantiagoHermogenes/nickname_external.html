        Starting my first year at St. Luke's College of Nursing, part of Trinity University of Asia, I'm diving into a new chapter both academically and personally. Standing at 5'1, I bring my passion for volleyball as a libero, combining athleticism with a love for the game. Beyond sports, I'm drawn to soft-hearted gentlemen who balance their interests in sports or music with genuine sensitivity. While I'm eager to meet new people and open to mingling, I tend to be on the shy side when it comes to navigating the dating scene.

        Navigating college life is exhilarating yet challenging, and I'm embracing the opportunities to grow academically and socially. At St. Luke's, I look forward to immersing myself in the nursing program while also exploring extracurricular interests. In my quest for companionship, I hope to find someone who respects my heart and shares my interests, making meaningful connections in an environment that values both intellect and compassion.
